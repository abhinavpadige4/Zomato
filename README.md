# Zomato
This project is a basic Zomato clone, created to simulate a restaurant discovery platform. Its primary goal is to integrate and test DevOps tools like Maven, Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and JUnit. The project demonstrates continuous integration, version control, and testing practices but is not a fully functional Zomato alternative.
