# Zomato Clone - Lab Activity

## Project Description
This is a basic **Zomato Clone** project created as part of a **lab activity** for testing and connecting various development tools such as **Maven**, **Git**, **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, and **JUnit**. The main objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience with integrating different tools commonly used in the software development lifecycle.

This project is designed to simulate a restaurant discovery platform, similar to Zomato, where users can search for restaurants, view details, and submit reviews. However, the focus of this project is **not** on building a fully-functional Zomato application, but on connecting the various tools to build a continuous integration pipeline, version control, and automated testing.

### Tools Integrated:
- **Maven** - Build and dependency management tool
- **Git** & **GitHub** - Version control and repository hosting
- **Jenkins** - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- **JUnit** - Unit testing framework
- **Docker** (Optional) - Containerization for deployment (if included)

### Purpose of the Project:
- **Testing CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins.
- **Connecting version control systems** (Git & GitHub) for collaboration and versioning.
- **Automated unit testing** using JUnit for testing core functionalities.
- **Build automation** using Maven to handle dependencies and project packaging.
- **Integration of tools** to work together seamlessly in a real-world development environment.

### How to Set Up the Project:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zomato-clone.git
   cd zomato-clone
